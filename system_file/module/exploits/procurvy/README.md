## HP Procurve Switch Config Disclosure 

Found these when cleaning up some old files over the weekend, there are two scripts. Both of them dump configs from certain HP Procurve switches. I don't have the notes associated with them any more, but I know they were disclosed to HP at some point.

Both of them use seemingly different ways to leak the config without authentication, again, I don't have the notes for these.
